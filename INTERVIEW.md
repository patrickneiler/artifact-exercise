# Candidate Coding Session Guide (Live Share)

Welcome! This repository is set up for your technical interview and practical coding task. Instead of launching your own Codespace, you'll join a **Live Share session** hosted by the interviewer. This guide walks you through the process, outlines expectations, and provides tips for a smooth experience.

## ðŸš€ Joining the Live Share Session

- At the scheduled time, your interviewer will send you a **Live Share invite link**.
- Click the link to open it in VS Code.
- Accept any prompts to install or enable the Live Share extension.
- You'll be connected to the interviewer's environment, with access to the full codebase and terminal (if enabled).

## ðŸ›  What You'll Be Doing

Your session will follow this structure:

### 1. **Introduction (5 min)**

- Briefly discuss your technical background and set expectations.

### 2. **Deep Dive Discussion (15â€“20 min)**

- Topics may include:
  - Component-based architecture & state management
  - Agentic reasoning and autonomous systems
  - Real-time UI and streaming data handling

### 3. **Practical Coding Task (20â€“30 min)**

- **Implement a feature or extend an artifact** (see below for ideas).
- Demonstrate technical understanding, error handling, and user feedback.
- Integrate agentic reasoning or real-time UI updates as appropriate.

### 4. **Code Review & Discussion (5â€“10 min)**

- Walk through your implementation.
- Discuss alternative approaches and scalability.

## ðŸ§© Tips for Success

- **No Local Setup Needed:** All dependencies and environment variables are managed by the host. You can focus solely on the code.
- **Live Collaboration:** Ask questions, pair program, and discuss your thought process in real time.
- **Streaming UI:** The app supports real-time updatesâ€”showcase your approach to handling streaming data and UI responsiveness.
- **Commit Often:** Use Git in the shared environment to save your work as you go.
- **Ask for Clarification:** Donâ€™t hesitate to clarify requirements or constraints at any time.

## ðŸ›¡ Security & Privacy

- All sensitive credentials are managed securely on the host machine.
- Your work will be saved and reviewed after the session.
